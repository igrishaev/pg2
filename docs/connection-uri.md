# URI Connection String

TODO

This page represents a brief table of query parameters of a URI string. They act
the same in general, although some names might differ (e.g. "boolean?" names
don't have a question mark at the end). For detailed explanation, please refer
to the [Connecting to the Server](/docs/connecting.md) section.
